This installation guide is directed toward developers as this project is in its early phases.

I. Pre-Requisites
    * PHP 5+
        - ZipArchive
        - MySQL Access
    * MySQL
        - One Database
    * HTTP Server
        - PHP Capabilities

II. Installation
    1. Copy SimpleSite to the path the server will access it from.
    2. Update $configs["path"]["root"] (if necessary)
        * Assuming the DOCUMENT_ROOT is /var/www/, and SimpleSite was in /var/www/SimpleSite_v1.1/, you should set this as
          /SimpleSite_v1.1/.
    4. Update $configs["database"]["host"] to the hostname the MySQL server is at.
    5. Update $configs["database"]["username"] to the MySQL username.
    6. Update $configs["database"]["password"] to the MySQL password.
    7. Update $configs["database"]["database"] to the MySQL database to connect to.
    8. Update $configs["database"]["tbl_prefix"] to the prefix you want to use for MySQL tables.
    9. Log into AdminCP (at http://site.name/configs/path/root/?mod=adminCP and go to the environment tester.
        * If any errors arise it will involve the database, any error in "path" will result in you being unable to view the site.
    10. It is recommended that you create a table SS_constants (where SS_ is the tbl_prefix) which will allow you to add constants 
        without having to update the configuration file.
        * You can do so by going to the database admin (from AdminCP) and executing a CREATE TABLE query.

        * $configs["path"]["mod_templates"]
            * The path to mod_templates (starts with $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].$configs['path']['root'] automatically - don't write it)

        * Possible Errors
            1. Templates directory does not exist.  How are you seeing this?
                * While you should theoretically not be able to see the admin panel without the templates directory
                  existing, if by some strange chance you do, you should create the directory you specified in
                  $configs["path"]["templates"].
            2. Modules directory does not exist, therefore no mods will be used.
                * This should also break the admin panel, however if it doesn't, you should create the includes/mods/
                  directory.
            3. Configuration file does not exist.
                * This should break the site in general, however if it dosn't, you should create includes/config.inc.php
            4. MySQL credentials are incorrect.
                * You should alter the database host/username/password in the config file
            5. ZipArchive is not installed, you will not be able to upload themes or modules.
                * You should install the ZipArchive PHP extension.
            6. Config file is not writable, you will not be able to edit it from the admin control panel.
                * Under Linux you should execute `chmod 755 includes/config.inc.php`
            7. Theme directory is not writable, you will not be able to upload new themes.
                * You should execute `chmod -R 755 your/theme/directory/path`
            8. Module templates directory is not writable, any modules you upload will not have the required templates.
                * You should execute `chmod -R 755 your/mod/templates/path`
            9. Custom templates directory is not writable, you will not be able to upload any files there.
                * You should execute chmod 755 your/custom/templates/path`
            10. Modules directory is not writable, you will not be able to upload any modules.

V. Adding On
    Follow the guides that came along with this file to develop either modules, themes, or
    widgets.  Once one is developed, you zip it up and save it ensuring proper file naming 
    conventions for whichever type of component it is.
