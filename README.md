Hello all, my name's Jon Stockton and I've been working on SimpleSite for the past 3 years or so.  It started off as an attempt to create a social networking platform, but after a computer crash and all that hardwork going away, I switched over to developing a framework to help me create the social network easier and faster.  My latest release was 1.5 (which you can find at http://simplesite1416.x10.mx/ ), but that is very different than how I want 2.0 to work.  I've been working on 2.0 for a little over a month, but with my time schedule (as I'm now working), it's been hard to find time to progress.  That's where you come in.

Ideally, I would like to build a community around this framework with the goal of creating a highly flexible, yet efficient framework with a small footprint.  After doing the initial commit, I will be setting up my "wish list" for the project.  That does not, of course, mean that you can't have your own ideas, I welcome any suggestions for enhancements and if I think they're cool ideas they'll be put in the repo.

That's all I have to say for now, hope you enjoy the framework.
