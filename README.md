Hello all, my name's Jon Stockton and I've been working on SimpleSite for the past 3 years or so.  It started off as an attempt to create a social networking platform, but after a computer crash and all that hardwork going away, I switched over to developing a framework to help me create the social network easier and faster.  My latest release was 1.5 (which you can find at http://simplesite1416.x10.mx/ ), but that is very different than how I want 2.0 to work.  Also note that all of my current versions are what I'm terming as "concept versions" to illustrate the overall system design.  The first actual production release will be given the version number: 1.0.0.  Anyways, I've been working on 2.0 for a little over a month, but with my time schedule (as I'm now working), it's been hard to find time to progress.  That's where you come in.

Ideally, I would like to build a community around this framework with the goal of creating a highly flexible, yet efficient framework with a small footprint.  Check out my wishlists and the backlog, there's plenty of work to be done.  Also, if you find any issues please submit them.

That's all I have to say for now, hope you enjoy the framework.
