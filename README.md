**1.0.0 Postponed - Getting busy lately, I plan on picking back up in a month or two**

**2.0 release finished, 1.0.0 in progress now**

Hello all, my name's Jon Stockton and I've been working on SimpleSite for the past 3 years or so.  It started off as an attempt to create a social networking platform, but after a computer crash and all that hardwork going away, I switched over to developing a framework to help me create the social network easier and faster.  My latest release is 2.0 which was originally going to be considered production ready, but is now just another concept version.

Ideally, I would like to build a community around this framework with the goal of creating a highly flexible, yet efficient framework with a small footprint.  Check out my wishlists and the backlog, there's plenty of work to be done.  Also, if you find any issues please submit them.

That's all I have to say for now, hope you enjoy the framework.


**Note** To follow the progress check out https://github.com/Jonnycake/SimpleSite/milestones .  I've made an effort to plan out the next year or so of development.  I'm currently in the 1.0.0 requirements gathering milestone (which will appear to be at a stand-still because the issues will just be broken out into the other milestones).  While doing the planning, I tried to take into account the issues in the requirements gathering milestone to more accurately predict when certain pieces will be completed.  Hopefully by August 29, 2015 all development will be done and I can start working on putting out components.
