Hello all, my name's Jon Stockton and I've been working on SimpleSite for the past 3 years or so.  It started off as an attempt to create a social networking platform, but after a computer crash and all that hardwork going away, I switched over to developing a framework to help me create the social network easier and faster.  My latest release was 1.5 (which you can find at http://simplesite1416.x10.mx/ ), but that is very different than how I want 2.0 to work.  I've been working on 2.0 for a little over a month, but with my time schedule (as I'm now working), it's been hard to find time to progress.  That's where you come in.

Ideally, I would like to build a community around this framework with the goal of creating a highly flexible, yet efficient framework with a small footprint.  Check out my wishlists and the backlog, there's plenty of work to be done.  Also, if you find any issues please submit them.

That's all I have to say for now, hope you enjoy the framework.


**Note** Currently, as there seems to be little interest in the project, I've been focusing more on the overall design of 1.0.0 and trying to see problems before they're encountered.  As you may have noticed, I've been adding quite a bit of issues.  Considering the design work left, the creation of helper classes, modules, widgets, themes, etc. I don't feel like I will make my original estimate of New Years 2015, but I do think that within the next year I'll finally be able to say that my project is production ready.

I do still plan on doing my 2.0 release within the next month, although it will be incomplete.  I mainly plan on providing the File access class (although this will become a wrapper for SplFileObject to avoid "reinventing the square wheel"), minor fixes for SimpleDB, and the SimpleDebug class.
