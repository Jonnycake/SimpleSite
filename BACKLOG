For now, due to these being the blocker on modules, etc. I am mainly looking for helper classes and libraries, I already started SimpleFile and SimpleDB.
Helper classes/libs:
	* SimpleFile
		- Support relative URLs
		- Delimeter compatability problems
		- getDirPath()
	* SimpleDirectory
		- Needs to be written
	* SimpleDate
		- Needs to be written
	* SimpleDB (lib)
		- Needs compatible queries for other database types
		- Need more effective storage for results
			- See line 422
	* SimpleDebug
		- Needs to be written

Design Stuff:
	* SimpleCSS
		- Pretty much done
		- Want this to be used in all default templates and themes
		- Needs to be updated for cross-browser compatability (mainly IE has caused a problem)
	* Themes:
		- Hacker Theme
		- Nature Theme
		- Give Some Ideas :)
